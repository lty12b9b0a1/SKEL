Your fixed JavaScript code should satisfy all the specifications.\n- You should output the code directly without explanations and always in the same format.\n- You should ALWAYS output best-effort translation, even if you are provided with partial code, modules, or code with dependencies.\n- You should keep the naming style unchanged for the function names and variables.\n- You should ALWAYS use `var` keyword for variable declarations in the translated code. AVOID using `let` or `const`.\n- The Python code is the body of a function or a generator function. You SHOULD return or yield in your translated code if the Python code does so.
